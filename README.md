# Doggy-Investigations

This is a guide that introduces some of the famous Digital Forensics tools written by great contributors.

Hopefully after reading the PDF guide, you should know about those tools and what they are used for and when and how.

This guide includes links to some resources for you to look through incase I haven't explained some of the tools thoroughly.  

This is a very tiny contribution gifted to you all <3 

I Hope you enjoy and benefit from the guide as much as i did. Good Luck with your Investigation Sherlock.
